# rnn

RNN implementations based on Deep Learning Course at UvA.

In `pytorch_rnn.py`, you can find implementations for `RNN`, LSTM` as well as GRU`
in a consistent manner.

You can train the above models with `train_pytorch_rnn_text.py` for text dataset. Or `train_pytorch_rnn.py` for
Pandridome dataset. The model can be changed by change
`model_type` run parameter.

A really good intro into PyTorch RNN is found:
